# Setup

1. You must either host the C# server off your LAN, or add an exception for it to your computercraft config (in /world/serverconfig/)
2. Edit the script to point at your C# server instance. It runs by default on port 2468.
3. Note that only the *server* needs to be able to see it - Clients will be handled by computercraft/minecraft itself.
